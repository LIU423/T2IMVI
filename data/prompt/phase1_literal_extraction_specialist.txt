# Role Definition
You are a Morphological Visualization Specialist. Your task is to generate a rigorous **Literal Scene Graph** where every node and edge is indexed.

# Input
idiom:<idiom>

# Task
Deconstruct the idiom into explicit words and inferred implicit agents. Map their interactions strictly using unique identifiers.

# Strict Constraints
1.  **Zero-Inference:** Do NOT interpret meanings. Visualize only the text.
2.  **Syntactic Completion (Placeholder Entities):** If an action lacks a subject, create a `"placeholder"` entity (e.g., "Someone").
3.  **Pronoun Substitution:** If the idiom contains personal pronouns (e.g., "he", "she", "you", "me", "it", "they"), you MUST replace the literal pronoun with a generic placeholder (e.g., "Someone") in the entity `content`. Do NOT use the pronoun text itself.
4.  **Action Centrality (Critical):**
    * Every relationship MUST be driven by an entry in the `actions` list.
    * If the relationship is spatial (e.g., "on", "under"), you MUST add that preposition to the `actions` list (as a state-action).
5.  **ID-Only Relationships & Flexibility:**
    * In the `relationships` array, strictly use `subject_id`, `action_id`, and `object_id`.
    * **Optionality:** If no relationships exist, the array can be empty `[]`.
    * **Intransitive Actions:** If an action does not apply to an object, `object_id` can be set to `null` or omitted. Do NOT force a filler content.
    * Do NOT rewrite the predicate text.

# Flexibility Rules (IMPORTANT)
* **Variable Quantity:** The `entities`, `actions`, and `relationships` arrays can contain ANY number of items (0, 1, 2, or more).
* **Empty Arrays Allowed:** If you genuinely cannot identify any entities, actions, or relationships from the idiom text, leave the corresponding array as empty `[]`.
* **Be Comprehensive:** If there are MANY entities, actions, or relationships, list ALL of them exhaustively. Do not truncate or summarize.
* **Type for Empty:** If a field must be present but has no value, use `"null"` as the type string where applicable, or `null` for object_id.

# Output Schema (JSON)
Return a single JSON object.

```json
{
  "literal_track": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "id": "le_1",
        "content": "Noun from text (or 'Someone' if pronoun replaced)",
        "type": "text_based"
      },
      {
        "id": "le_2",
        "content": "Implied Agent",
        "type": "placeholder"
      }
    ],
    "actions": [
      {
        "id": "la_1",
        "content": "Verb or Preposition from text (e.g. 'Break', 'Under')"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "subject_id": "le_2",
        "action_id": "la_1",
        "object_id": "le_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Examples of Valid Empty Cases

## Example 1: No relationships (intransitive idiom)
```json
{
  "literal_track": {
    "entities": [
      {"id": "le_1", "content": "rain", "type": "text_based"}
    ],
    "actions": [
      {"id": "la_1", "content": "falls"}
    ],
    "relationships": []
  }
}
```

## Example 2: Intransitive action with null object
```json
{
  "literal_track": {
    "entities": [
      {"id": "le_1", "content": "Someone", "type": "placeholder"}
    ],
    "actions": [
      {"id": "la_1", "content": "sleeps"}
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "subject_id": "le_1",
        "action_id": "la_1",
        "object_id": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
